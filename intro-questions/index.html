    <p> Hi! my name is Sabrina Urban (she/her/hers). I'm a junior currently studying Communication Design and double majoring in Film production. </p>
    <p> I'm not much of a coder. In fact I took a class once in high school... it put a damper on my experience and I didn't really want to code ever again. I wish I could say I wanted to take this class for fun </p>
    <p> I have limited knowledge. I can sort of write basic code, but I'm not great. And I think the bit that I know how to write is for html. </p>
    <p> I hope to pass this class and retain the information that is taught. As for what I'm taught, I hope that it's relevant to graphic design. Maybe learn how to build my own portfolio website? </p>
    <p> I know that designing for paper and designing for screen are two very different things. firstly the color wheels that are referred to are different. Secondly, with designing for the screen the designer has to accomodate for the changing of screens. What looks good on a phone might not look good on a computer screen. </p>

    <p>i chose this website because I think the design is clean and simple. The website is easy to navigate, but also my art is on it (the icons for efficiency, consistency, and accountability)</p>
    <p>communication:http://foundations2021fall.wudesign.me/syllabus.php </p>
    <p>it's clear in terms of what it's trying to convey, the audience doesn't have to look around for something. it's clean and concise but also I know exactly what kinof website this</p>
    <p>in general:https://google.com </p>
    <p> google is the most commonly used website, with probably the most flow. it's simple and straight foraward to navigate. Maybe I'm just saying because im almost as old as google but i think it's a solid website.</p>
